Months ago, I read an article that was written by my favorite blogger, [Haohailong](http://weibo.com/haohailong): [Everybody should build his own writing space](http://shengmingzhiqing.com/blog/everybody-should-build-his-own-writing-space.html/).

Out of such motivation, I decided to move my blog from once heavy blogging platform WordPress to the well-known, lighter platform Jekyll.

Hosted with Github Pages, Jekyll also allows people to sync their posts with Git, which helps to concentrate on writing better, especially without those annoying backends. 

Jekyll, here I come!
